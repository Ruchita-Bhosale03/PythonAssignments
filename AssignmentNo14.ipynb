    "RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors using combinations of red, green, and blue channels, along with an alpha channel for transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RGBA color model, each channel (red, green, blue, and alpha) is represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 255 or a floating-point value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The alpha channel determines the transparency or opacity of the color, with 0.0 representing fully transparent and 1.0 representing fully opaque.\n",

    "The RGBA color model is widely used in computer graphics, image processing, and web design. It allows for precise control over color and transparency, enabling the creation of various visual effects and smooth blending of objects and layers."
