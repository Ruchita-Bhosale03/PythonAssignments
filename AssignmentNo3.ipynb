    "Functions provide several advantages in programming. Here are some of the key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task. This code can be reused multiple times throughout your program or in different programs. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions help in organizing code into smaller, manageable, and independent units. Each function can focus on a specific task or functionality, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Breaking down a program into smaller functions also enables collaboration among multiple developers working on different parts of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions provide a level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a particular functionality. When you call a function, you don't need to know how it works internally; you only need to know how to use it and what inputs it expects. This abstraction simplifies the complexity of the program and allows you to work at a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Well-designed functions with descriptive names can make your code more readable and self-explanatory. By giving meaningful names to functions, you can convey the purpose or action the function performs, making the overall code easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and Debugging: Functions facilitate testing and debugging of code. Since functions encapsulate specific tasks, you can test each function independently, making it easier to identify and isolate issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Code maintenance: Functions promote code maintainability by allowing you to make changes or updates in a centralized manner. If you need to modify a specific functionality, you can make the changes within the corresponding function, without affecting other parts of the code.\n"

    "Global Scope: The global scope refers to the outermost level of a Python program. It is the top-level scope where variables and functions are defined outside of any function or class. Any variable or function defined in the global scope can be accessed and used throughout the program, including within functions or nested scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Scopes: Local scopes are created whenever a function is called. Each function call creates its own local scope, which is a separate scope that exists only within that function call. Variables defined within a function are considered to be in the local scope of that function. These variables are accessible only within the function and its nested blocks.\n",
